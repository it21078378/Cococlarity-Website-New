                    Coconut cultivation is widespread across Sri Lanka, with
                    coconut palms covering a considerable portion of the
                    country's land. The coconut tree is often referred to as the
                    "tree of life" in Sri Lanka due to the versatility and the
                    multitude of products derived from the coconut. Sri Lanka
                    exports a significant amount of coconut oil to various
                    countries around the world. The country is known for
                    producing high-quality virgin coconut oil (VCO), which is
                    extracted from fresh coconut meat without undergoing
                    chemical refining. Sri Lanka has numerous coconut oil
                    processing facilities scattered across the country. These
                    facilities process coconuts into oil through methods such as
                    cold-pressing or expeller pressing to retain the oil's natural
                    flavor and nutrients. Some larger facilities may also engage
                    in refining processes to produce refined coconut oil. Sri
                    Lankan coconut oil manufacturers adhere to strict quality
                    standards to ensure that their products meet international
                    requirements, which include compliance with food safety
                    regulations and certifications such as ISO (International
                    Organization for Standardization) and HACCP (Hazard
                    Analysis and Critical Control Points).

                    Sri Lanka is the fourth-largest coconut producer as of 2021
                    [1] and, as Table 1 shows, the seventh-largest coconut oil
                    producer as of 2019 [2]. Because the country has an
                    abundance of coconut resources, Sri Lankans have an
                    outstanding chance to increase the country's earnings by
                    generating more coconut oil.
